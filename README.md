•	Role:
  o	I designed it independently.
  
•	What was good:
  o	The styling is clean and easy to read. The animation is smooth and isn’t too fast or slow.
  
•	What I would change:
  o	I would make separate files for the data and JavaScript to make it more organized.
  o	I would annotate the spikes to help the user better understand the data.
