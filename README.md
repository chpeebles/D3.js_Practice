<b>Role:</b> I designed these charts independently.

<b>What was good:</b> The styling is clean and easy to read. The animation is smooth and isnâ€™t too fast or slow.

<b>What I would change:</b> I would make separate files for the data and JavaScript to make it more organized. I would annotate the spikes to help the user better understand the data.
